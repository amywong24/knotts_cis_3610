                                    <h4>Dining</h4>
                                    <p>Since the beginning, food and dining has been at the heart of Knott’s Berry Farm.
                                        Before
                                        there was a theme park, Knott’s was a real berry farm where the boysenberry was
                                        first successfully
                                        grown. In 1934 Mrs. Knott’s Chicken Dinner Restaurant first opened with Mrs.
                                        Knott
                                        and her children serving the first customers in their tea room. The restaurant
                                        has
                                        grown over the
                                        years into one of the largest in California, but the classic fried chicken
                                        dinner is
                                        still made
                                        the same way today
                                        using Mrs. Knott's recipes. What started as a small family berry farm soon began
                                        to
                                        grow into a world famous destination thanks to famous fried chicken dinners and
                                        delicious
                                        boysenberry pies.
                                        That culinary innovation still thrives today at Knott’s. Our team of chefs is
                                        always
                                        striving to
                                        bring you new flavors and tasty creations.</p>
